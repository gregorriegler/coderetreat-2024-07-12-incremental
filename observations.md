1. Iteration
Copy-paste from ChatGPT gives result
2. Iteration
Without context, new implementation not related to existing one
With context, implementation is correct but test cases fail
We are still in the same session

We change session:
* Code != functionality, i.e. how do we reference the existing implementation in the prompt
  how do we relate to it when we say it should be extended?
* New session leads to new implementation

We cannot prompt to force adjustment of existing tests

TBD:
* Effect of session (fresh vs ongoing)
* With or without tests
